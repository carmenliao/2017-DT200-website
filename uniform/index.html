					<p> 
					It's important that students are prepared for learning, and to do so, they are required to have correct uniform. There are 2 different sets of uniform. Students are expected to wear the correct uniform sets, depending on what term it is and also for special occasions. The two sets of uniform are:</p>
					
					<li> Summer uniform</li>
					<li> Winter uniform</li>
					
					<p>Most of the uniform reflects the schoolâ€™s representative colours - blue and gold. The students are expected to wear their uniform with pride, in school, and even out of school. Sometimes, students are required to wear a 'formal' set of uniform. However, this is usually only worn on formal occasions, such as the school prizegiving. </p>
					
					<p> WEGC DOES NOT allow jewellery, nail polish and certain earrings to be worn.</p>
					<p>However, despite WEGC having a uniform, the school still advocates individuality, and encourages students to 'be themselves'. For example, students are allowed to dye their hair, and have any hairstyle they want. </p>
